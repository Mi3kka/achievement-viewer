# üèÜ Achievement Viewer üèÜ

## Description

Achievement Viewer is a Next.js based web application that allows users to track their video game achievements. It displays a list of owned games, as well as the achievements the user has unlocked for each game. The application also provides filters and sorting mechanisms to facilitate the search for specific achievements.

This is primarily a demo project to showcase a front-end achievement environment. It is not intended to be a fully functional full-stack application as it is missing a back-end database and user authentication. However, it does simulate a full environment by storing data in a dummy-data.js file, fetching data and populating elements within React components. The data works as the backbone of the application and is used to populate the main view, as well as the filters and sorting mechanisms.

##  Access the web application

The application is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed at the following URL:

[https://achievement-viewer.vercel.app/](https://achievement-viewer.vercel.app/)

## Features

- Display a list of owned games with their achievements & stats.
- Filter and search for achievements based on game name, achievement status (locked/unlocked), visibility, and more.
- Sort achievements based on global unlocks and unlock dates.
- Color-coded completion percentages to visually show progress on the main view.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop. Tested on multiple device-sizes.
- Steam-like UI design.
- You can add your own data to the dummy-data.js file to test the application with different parameters and data.

## Installation and development setup

1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Mi3kka/achievement-viewer.git```

2. Install Node.js and npm if you don't have them already:

[https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)

This app works best with Node.js version 18.16.0.

3. Install dependencies:

```npm install```

4. Run the development server:

```npm run dev```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Development should be done on a feature branch. Once the feature is complete, create a pull request to merge the feature branch into the main branch.

## Technologies used

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Next.js (React framework)](https://nextjs.org/)
- [CSS (for global styling)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)
- [Bootstrap (for some inline styling)](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Node.js & npm](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Project structure

- **app** - Contains the login page and the initial page that is displayed when a client loads web application. The login page is not functional, but it is there to simulate a login page. Also contains footers, which are used on all pages.
- **pages** - Contains the main view page that is the entry point of the application. Can be extended to cover other pages as well.
- **src/components** - Contains React components that are used to build the application UI. For example the achievement container is a component, and that component houses achievement cards, which are also components.
- **dummy-data** - Contains the dummy-data.js file, which is used to populate the application with data.
- **public** - Contains sub directories for images and icons that are used in the application and by the dummy-data.
- **styles** - Contains CSS files that are used to style the application beyond Bootstrap's inline styling.

## Future suggestions

- Add a back-end database to store user data (e.g. MongoDB)
- Add user authentication along with Steam and other platforms, which store game achievements (e.g. Xbox, PlayStation, etc.)
